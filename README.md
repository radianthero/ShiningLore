# ShiningLore

# As of this time, there are no servers to play on. If you want to help and start hosting these servers, then feel free to reach out!

Shining Lore is a dead MMO from 2002; it was canceled in beta.

There was a private server hosted around 2005 in China, hosted by slodt, ([Archive of the forums](https://web.archive.org/web/20070818090459/http://bbs.slodt.com/index.php)). They were shut down sometime around 2007.

I'm unsure how the server files were leaked then, but they were re-uploaded in 2015 on the ragezone forums, which can be found here [https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/release-shining-lore-online-server-client-tools.1059923/]

The original upload of the files has since gone down, but someone reuploaded it on the Internet Archive in 2019 ([Re-upload of files](https://archive.org/details/ShiningLore))

For more info on how to host a server/setup the client, please look at the Wiki page ([here](https://github.com/radianthero/ShiningLore/wiki)).
