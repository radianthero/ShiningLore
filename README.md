# ShiningLore

# As of this time, there are no servers to play on, if you want to help, or know someone who hosted these servers, please reach out!

Shining Lore is a dead MMO from 2002; it was canceled in beta and has been dead ever since. 

There was a private server hosted around 2005 in China, hosted by slodt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070818090459/http://bbs.slodt.com/index.php]. They were shut down sometime around 2007.

I'm unsure how the server files were leaked then, but they were re-uploaded in 2015 on the ragezone forums, which can be found here [https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/release-shining-lore-online-server-client-tools.1059923/]

The original upload of the files has since gone down, but someone reuploaded it on the Internet Archive in 2019 [https://archive.org/details/ShiningLore]

And now in 2025, I'm trying to figure out how to get the servers back online.

For more info/leads that I've had, please look at the Wiki page ([here](https://github.com/radianthero/ShiningLore/wiki)).
